# Exploring with Malware Classification

## Problem Statement

Distinguishing and classifying malware from benign software and malware is important. Malware may steal sentitive and confidential information stored on devices or install malicious software to spy on computer activities and even take control of the device. This not only will pose a threat to personal computer security, but also can damage servers from companies or governments, leading to unpredictable consequences.

Distinguish such malicious software is of vital importance in software engineering. A dataset built with head fields' values of portable executable files has been used in this project.

The task is to find a method with which we can distinguish malware in a high accuracy.
## Impact/Benefits
If there exists an effective method with which we can detect malicious software, a large amount of money that will be spent on addressing problems caused by malware could be saved and many important pieces of data can stay from being stolen or damaged.

## Contribution
Normalization in this project helped improve the stability of dataset and also the performance.
The proposed solution improved the prediction accuracy from 60% up to more than 93% and f1 score from 53% to around 90% by applying and genetic algorithms.
(By grid search the accuracy can be improved nearly 10%-20% depending on which model)

## Plan
- Inspect the dataset and perform preprocessing
- Use the Gaussian Naive Bayes as baseline
- Train the dataset using several naive bayes methods after normalization
- Apply grid search for optimization
- Use the genetic algorithm for feature selection

## Results/Conclusions

Normalization + Genetic algorithm: improve performance
